I'm an Academic Clinical Fellow in my first year (ST1) of Obstetrics and Gynaecology training. I'm based between University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, and the University of Leicester.

I completed my Foundation Year 1 and 2 at [UHMB](https://www.uhmb.nhs.uk/) as part of the Specialised Foundation Programme (Research track). My research block focussed on understanding the microbiome of diabetic leg ulcers and how antibiotics are used in the Trust.
