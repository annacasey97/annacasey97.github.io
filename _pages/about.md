I'm an Academic Clinical Fellow in my first year (ST1) of Obstetrics and Gynaecology training, based between UHL and the University of Leicester. My research is mainly focussed on gynaecological cancer, in particular uterine cancers. My other professional interests include global health, healthcare in remote and resource-limited settings, as well as education. Outside of work I enjoy reading, travelling and exploring nature.

I find intersections between different specialties, scientific disciplines and ways of thinking really motivating, and have gathered (I think) a really diverse set of experiences to draw upon in my work.

I completed my Foundation Year 1 and 2 at [UHMB](https://www.uhmb.nhs.uk/) as part of the Specialised Foundation Programme (Research track). My research block focussed on understanding the microbiome of diabetic leg ulcers and how antibiotics are used in the Trust. I really enjoyed my time and proximity to the [Lake District for hiking](https://www.walkingenglishman.com/lakes.htm).

My BMBS is from [Brighton and Sussex Medical School](https://www.bsms.ac.uk/index.aspx). As a student I like to think I made the most of my time, joining [Students for Global Health](https://studentsforglobalhealth.org/) as national secretary, participated in the [ESA gravity-related research summer school](https://www.esa.int/Education/ESA_Academy/Current_opportunities_for_university_students), and participated in the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science's [Young Scientist Program](https://bmsis.org/ysp/), where my research focussed on the effects of space radiation on astronauts, as well as teaching the next generation of scientists via Zoom!

In 2020 I graduated from the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) with my MSc International Disaster Management from the [Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute](https://www.hcri.manchester.ac.uk/). My thesis focussed on the evidence base underpinning international medical reponses to sudden-onset disasters, encouraging us to think outside traditional evidence hierarchies. This was disrupted by the pandemic which has itself triggered conversations around evidence hierarchies! During this year I undertook a placement at the [Association of Greater Manchester Authorities Civil Contingencies and Resilience Unit](https://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/200039/emergencies/6303/preparing_for_emergencies/3) which was a great way of expanding my awareness of emergency response beyond medicine.

Please reach out if any of this sounds interesting, I'm always excited to share my experiences and help others get involved with their areas of interest!
