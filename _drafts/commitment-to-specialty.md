"Commitment to specialty" is something people ask about at all stages of medical school, and some aspects are way easier to manage if you start them early. Let's get into it.

# CST and other surgical ambitions

The [2025 CST portfolio scoring guidelines](https://medical.hee.nhs.uk/medical-training-recruitment/medical-specialty-training/surgery/core-surgery/core-surgical-training-self-assessment-scoring-guidance-for-candidates) are out, and you should have a look at them.

To maximise your points in this section, you'll need verified logbook evidence of over 40 cases, as well as one of: at least 5 taster days (total), at least 4 weeks on an elective, or a FY placement in a surgical specialty.

I think the main problem here is the cases, to be honest. Firstly, everyone should have a surgical rotation in FY, and if you don't, organising 5 non-consecutive taster days shouldn't be too difficult. If you get a relevant elective sorted, even easier. 

## The cases - the UK pan-surgical logbook

The [Pan-Surgical Electronic Logbook for the United Kingdom and Ireland](https://www.elogbook.org/) is what you'll need to demonstrate involvement in â‰¥40 cases. NB _"Involvement" means "scrubbed in" - not observing._

Step 1: make an account (straightforward)
Step 2: start recording cases (relatively straightforward, fun fact! gynaecological procedures and C-sections count as general surgery)
Step 3: get those cases signed off (complicated)

The most complicated bit will be the validation/sign off. Go to "browse operations" --> "request trainer validation". You can also, for trainers who are not as technologically adept/up to date/registered on the elogbook etc., print off the list and get a physical signature.

Then scan these in and save them as a PDF ready to upload as evidence.

Happy scrubbing!

# IMT and other medical specialties

IMT does not use commitment to specialty in the [2025 guidance](https://www.imtrecruitment.org.uk/recruitment-process/applying/application-scoring)

[Histopathology](https://medical.hee.nhs.uk/medical-training-recruitment/medical-specialty-training/pathology/histopathology/overview-of-histopathology/histopathology-training-self-assessment-scoring-guidance-for-applicants): 3+ days taster, or an FY rotation/'extended period of training' (who knows what that means). You also get separate points for 'histopathology-related activities' which appear to be a related publication and/or presentation.

# Overall

Other than these examples, it is worth finding out what your specialty of choice looks for - if anything. If you start optimising your portfolio now, it'll be one less thing to worry about closer to the time.

Generally, attending things like conferences, getting involved in student groups, and making the most of any opportunities is a good strategy. The more people you meet who are doing things in the area you're interested in, the more people you have to ask for advice.
