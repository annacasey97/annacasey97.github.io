I've got my MRCOG part 1 exam on the 1st of July this year. With that in mind, I'd like to document my approach to this so once I have my result I can learn from it for whichever exam I need to sit next.

# Strategy

## Domains

Not all the domains in the exam are created equal. With that in mind, I've made a list in order of size (based on the pie charts in the first chapter of the [Essential Guide](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/mrcog-part-one/your-essential-revision-guide-mrcog-part-one/50E01B02017A3AA543EFD5DA556A05FF)).

## Qbanks and Anki

I've then got some subscriptions to question banks, and based on the list of domains, I go through the topics in the banks. For example, I'll do anatomy first, and microbiology a few domains later as it's not as heavily weighted.

When I do my questions, I create Anki flashcards as I go based on 3 things:

1. Things I get wrong (obvious)
2. Things I get _right_, but where I don't know important reasoning behind the answers
3. Things that keep coming up (so they must be important, right?)

I then do my Anki daily. I have a streak, and it's motivating to keep it going. The benefit of this is that I see things I get wrong more often, more often - thanks to spaced repetition - so I'm not using up question bank questions on this.

I _don't do_ the Qbanks daily. Each block of around 100 questions takes a while (depending on domain and repetition of themes), especially when making flashcards properly, so I tend to only do this on standard days or days off.

## Mocks

I do a mock roughly once per month, at the end of the month, to track progress and practice under closer-to-exam conditions (i.e. not doing flashcards at the gym). I'm planning to spend June doing basically straight mocks rather than practice questions, in hopes that this will help get me into the right mindset and practicing exam technique.

## Courses

I'm planning on attending the RCOG course for the part 1. My colleagues have mentioned other courses, so we will see.

# Challenges

I'm documenting what I think my main challenges are, so I can see how I view this in a few years' time.

## Time

As a doctor in the NHS, you're working 48h on average per week. Unlike at university, you're expected to revise for these major exams at the same time as working clinically. This is a challenge. On weeks where I have night shifts, I am pleased if I get a few Anki questions just to keep my streak, rather than focussing on doing loads.

## Clinical relevance

I think it would be easier if the information I need to know for the MRCOG Part 1 was more clinically relevant in the day-to-day job. Things like embryology, or amino acids, are just not things that affect the ward round, discharge summaries, surgery lists or any of the other jobs my fellow SHOs and myself do. Of course they can be made to be relevant - for example reviewing developmental stages and how medications can affect things at different gestations, but this exam is more theoretical than applied, so my day-to-day doesn't really prompt on-the-job revision.
