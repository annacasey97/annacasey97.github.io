One of the major stresses for any medical student or doctor in the UK looking at entering specialty training is your portfolio. And I don't mean Horus! What is a portfolio? What needs to go in it? What looks good? And most importantly: how can I maximise the usefulness of my time spent working hard on all these extra things?

Disclaimer: I am NOT suggesting my CV is particularly incredible. I have had a lot of guidance from various sources and learnt along the way, so the point of this is more to share some of my experiences and approaches, rather than being some sort of guarantee of success.

Onwards!

# Part 1: what goes into a medical CV or portfolio?

For this we first look to the BMJ: [Preparing the perfect medical CV](https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d5289) by Green, 2011. I know it's like 100 years old. The important thing here is that it's *transferable*. None of these headings are specific to any specialty, it's all completely template.

My advice would be to create a CV on Google Docs or something similar - critically, something you're going to keep up-to-date(!) and create headings as in that article. For some of them you might have a lot, and others may not have anything yet. It's important to do this to see a) where you can improve and focus your efforts, as well as b) giving you something to pat yourself on the back about and say "actually, I've achieved a lot in X area".

General advice: I think all of these are easier to achieve whilst a student. There! I said it. I know that many people will have other things going on at university - some will be carers, or parents, or working. However, once you start as a doctor with an average of 48h working weeks, your extra time to spend doing superfluous things is going to be even more precious. That's not to say it's impossible, just that it's harder.

For those of you further along and looking at specialty applications, the website of your chosen specialty recruitment office is your guiding document. I'll take Core Surgical Training as an example. [Here](https://medical.hee.nhs.uk/medical-training-recruitment/medical-specialty-training/surgery/core-surgery/core-surgical-training-self-assessment-scoring-guidance-for-candidates)'s the link to the website for 2024/2025 entry. Have a look! You will see a lot of overlap with those generic headings in Green, 2011 above.

However, there are also extra things to think about - certain sections are either added or missing; and there is a *numerical score* attached to bits. That's not normal CV behaviour and needs to be thought about strategically.

It's worth also mentioning that this is for 2024/2025 entry, and will be updated yearly. Summaries of changes are at the top of the webpage, but normally it's nothing drastic - mainly to do with specifics around exactly how many points everything gets, rather than saying "nobody cares about audit any more".

For those of you applying to specialty training, use your CV template from Green, 2011 and customise it for your specialty. Move bits to the bottom if they don't matter, and under each heading write what gets you the top possible score. This will help focus your efforts.

# Part 2: Focussing your efforts

I think it's worth keeping this article general and doing a series of posts about specific aspects of the portfolio scoring. Having said this there are some general pointers to keep in mind. These mainly focus around saving time.

## You do not have time to maximise scoring across all domains, unless you've started in childhood/infancy

If you are reading this as a final year student or FY doctor, you do not have time to get from 0 to top points across all domains. With this in mind, make sure anything you do on top of your day job is getting you more points.

Example: QI project

Let's say you're an FY1 who did a full-cycle quality improvement project in medical school (nerd). Now, you want to apply for [Internal Medicine Training (IMT)](https://www.imtrecruitment.org.uk/recruitment-process/applying/application-scoring). That QI work already gets you 3 out of 4 points for the QI portion of their portfolio assessment. The only way you can get more points (that is, 4/4), is to do TWO full cycles of a QI project. 

Now you have a choice: you could continue your previous one to get another cycle out of it; if that is not feasible (for example you're not at the same Trust for FY1) you could try and start a whole other QI project and get 2 cycles out of it; or you could decide to do neither as you have more points to gain in other aspects of the portfolio scoring system, for example you have no teaching experience at all.

Depending on your personal situation and priorities, any one of those options might make sense. It's just about finding how you can make the most of your limited time.

## If you've already maximised a domain, ignore it

Let's say you want to do [Histopathology](https://medical.hee.nhs.uk/medical-training-recruitment/medical-specialty-training/pathology/histopathology/overview-of-histopathology/histopathology-training-self-assessment-scoring-guidance-for-applicants), and you've already presented a histopathology research poster you did at a regional meeting. You're now being offered another project to do which will likely be presented at the same regional meeting next year. Whilst this sounds great - two presentations! - you're actually not getting any additional points for this. 

The only way this would be worth it from a portfolio perspective is for your work to be presented nationally or internationally as an oral presentation - as this would score in the "presentations/posters" section as well as the "Histopathology related activities" section. If you're not going to do that, you should say no.

Note, though, that each thing can only be scored in one section. For example, if you gave an oral presentation at a national conference, you couldn't use that in both "presentations/posters" and "Histopathology related activities". However, if you both presented a poster at a regional conference and then turned it into an international oral presentation, that would count as it would be two different activities.

## Quality > quantity

If you've already got an international oral presentation and maximised your points in that domain, you don't get extra points for doing another one. I have met people who have done 10+ QI projects, but because none of them repeated the cycle, they don't get maximum points.

Don't waste time repeating things at a level which won't get you extra points.

## Pushing at open doors

If you're passionate about neurosurgery and are applying for [CST](https://medical.hee.nhs.uk/medical-training-recruitment/medical-specialty-training/surgery/core-surgery/core-surgical-training-self-assessment-scoring-guidance-for-candidates) as above. Sadly, you don't have a neurosurgery rotation that'll get you loads of operative experience. Fortunately, you don't need it. To maximise your "operative experience" score you need to be involved - i.e. scrubbed - for 40 operations. It does not specify which ones. Therefore, regardless of your surgical rotation's specialty, you can still get this by aiming to get as much experience as possible.

# Part 3: putting it all together

For anything you're going to submit for specialty recruitment applications, they may ask for proof. Create a folder on your computer, and save everything you might need to provide to prove your work. Degree certificates, QIP certificates, teaching feedback etc.

Your folder structure should hopefully mirror your CV in this way. When you add something like a certificate, remember to update your CV. That way you're guaranteed to be up to date with everything.
