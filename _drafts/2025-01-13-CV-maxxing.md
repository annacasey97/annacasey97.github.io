One of the major stresses for any medical student or doctor in the UK looking at entering specialty training is your portfolio. And I don't mean Horus! What is a portfolio? What needs to go in it? What looks good? And most importantly: how can I maximise the usefulness of my time spent working hard on all these extra things?

Disclaimer: I am NOT suggesting my CV is particularly incredible. I have had a lot of guidance from various sources and learnt along the way, so the point of this is more to share some of my experiences and approaches, rather than being some sort of guarantee of success.

Onwards!

# Part 1: what goes into a medical CV or portfolio?

For this we first look to the BMJ: [Preparing the perfect medical CV](https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d5289) by Green, 2011. I know it's like 100 years old. The important thing here is that it's *transferable*. None of these headings are specific to any specialty, it's all completely template.

My advice would be to create a CV on Google Docs or something similar - critically, something you're going to keep up-to-date(!) and create headings as in that article. For some of them you might have a lot, and others may not have anything yet. It's important to do this to see a) where you can improve and focus your efforts, as well as b) giving you something to pat yourself on the back about and say "actually, I've achieved a lot in X area".

General advice: I think all of these are easier to achieve whilst a student. There! I said it. I know that many people will have other things going on at university - some will be carers, or parents, or working. However, once you start as a doctor with an average of 48h working weeks, your extra time to spend doing superfluous things is going to be even more precious. That's not to say it's impossible, just that it's harder.

For those of you further along and looking at specialty applications, the website of your chosen specialty recruitment office is your guiding document. I'll take Core Surgical Training as an example. [Here](https://medical.hee.nhs.uk/medical-training-recruitment/medical-specialty-training/surgery/core-surgery/core-surgical-training-self-assessment-scoring-guidance-for-candidates)'s the link to the website for 2024/2025 entry. Have a look! You will see a lot of overlap with those generic headings in Green, 2011 above.

However, there are also extra things to think about - certain sections are either added or missing; and there is a *numerical score* attached to bits. That's not normal CV behaviour and needs to be thought about strategically.

It's worth also mentioning that this is for 2024/2025 entry, and will be updated yearly. Summaries of changes are at the top of the webpage, but normally it's nothing drastic - mainly to do with specifics around exactly how many points everything gets, rather than saying "nobody cares about audit any more".

For those of you applying to specialty training, use your CV template from Green, 2011 and customise it for your specialty. Move bits to the bottom if they don't matter, and under each heading write what gets you the top possible score. This will help focus your efforts.

# Part 2: Focussing your efforts

I think it's worth keeping this article general and doing a series of posts about specific aspects of the portfolio scoring.
