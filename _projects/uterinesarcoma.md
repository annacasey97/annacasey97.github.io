# Uterine sarcoma research

During my ACF years I am working with Dr Esther Moss on research into uterine sarcoma. This page will be periodically updated with news and outputs.

## My research

My research is focussing on the use of ctDNA in the diagnosis and monitoring of uterine sarcoma. See below for information on [uterine sarcoma](#What-is-uterine-sarcoma?) and [diagnostic challenges](#diagnostic-challenges).

I have presented a poster at BGCS 2025 - see my short post about it [here](https://annacasey97.github.io/blog/2025/BGCS2025/). This summarised a systematic review into the use of ctDNA for diagnosis and monitoring of uterine sarcoma.

## What is uterine sarcoma?

**Uterine sarcoma** is a type of **uterine cancer**, or womb cancer, which affects the **smooth muscle** or **connective tissue** of the uterus. It's not the same thing as endometrial cancer, which is another type of uterine cancer affecting the endometrium, or lining (the bit that sheds off when you have a period).

Whilst endometrial cancer represents [96% of all uterine cancers](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/uterine-cancer/incidence#heading-Three), **sarcoma only represents about [2-5% of uterine cancers](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/uterine-sarcoma/about/key-statistics.html)**.

## Diagnostic challenges

There are a few barriers to quick identification of uterine sarcoma.

### Vague symptoms

Firstly, the [symptoms](https://sarcoma.org.uk/about-sarcoma/what-is-sarcoma/types-of-sarcoma/gynaecological-sarcoma/) are not exactly specific:

1. New **bleeding after menopause**
2. Change in **bleeding pattern** (for example heavier, more frequent periods)
3. Abdominal **pain/bloating**
4. Noticeable **lump** or **swelling**

Any of these could be accounted for by any number of **other diagnoses**, making it really difficult to identify people who are likely to have sarcoma based on their symptoms alone.

Because it's a **rare cancer**, it makes these **symptoms less useful** in predicting who might need further workup and who can be reassured.

### Is it a fibroid?

Secondly, current approaches are **not that accurate**. These include:

1. **Examination** (for example feeling your abdomen in clinic, or performing a speculum examination)
2. **Imaging** (like CT or MRI scans)
3. **Biopsy** (for example during a hysteroscopy)

But it also sometimes happens that someone having **another procedure**, like a hysterectomy or fibroid surgery for another reason, finds out the tissue that got taken out had sarcoma. This is called an **'incidental' finding** - where we **weren't looking for something, but found it by surprise**.

The problem is that **none of these approaches are very good at identifying sarcoma**, because it [**doesn't have any specific features**](https://www.ejgo.net/articles/10.22514/ejgo.2024.071). 

**Fibroids** are **benign** lumps that grow in the same place as uterine sarcoma - but they **aren't cancer**. A CT or MRI scan can sometimes indicate if something is **likely** to be a cancer, but it can't say **for sure**.

Fibroids are **very common** - if you have a uterus, chances are about [2 in 3](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fibroids/) you'll get at least one during your life. Most of the time they **don't have any symptoms**, but when they do, they are similar to the symptoms above - bleeding, abdominal pain, bloating, lumps.

This makes it really difficult to say if a lump which has been found is cancer or not - it **probably isn't**, but **what if it's cancer**?

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.


To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    ---
    layout: page
    title: project
    description: a project with a background image
    img: /assets/img/12.jpg
    ---

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```
