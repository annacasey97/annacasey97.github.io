I get a lot of questions from medical students and more junior doctors in their foundation years about clinical academic training, so I thought I'd address some points here. Hopefully you find it useful in planning your own career.

# Clinical academic training: what is it?
Broadly, clinical academic training is a way of generating clinical doctors as well as other clinicians who are also able to conduct research and work in higher education settings, for example as Professors.

This post will focus on the UK context, as well as the medical context - i.e. this will cover the career pathway for medical doctors. It should also be noted that these pathways are constantly changing as the medical workforce planning in the UK is under constant discussion, and I'll do my best to keep this as up-to-date as possible.

It is also important to note that whilst this will cover the training pathway in a linear fashion, it's not always going to be linear for everyone. It's easiest to present the information like this but [the map is not the terrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation) and lots of people have taken lots of different routes to get to similar places.

In essence, you can think of clinical academic training as an 'add-on' to your usual medical training. You apply for posts at the same time and through the same channels as usual (that's Oriel), and you need to meet your clinical training requirements as well.

The earliest place to get involved is through the Specialised Foundation Programme or [SFP](https://foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/programmes/2-year-foundation-programme/specialised-foundation-programme/). This is organised through the UK Foundation Programme Organisation or UKFPO, and you'll apply at the same time as your normal FP application. Please read through the various parts of the website carefully - the process for 2025 changed recently, and nobody has experience of it yet.

The SFP follows the same pattern as any other FP: 6 rotations over 2 years lasting 4 months each. These may be in any specialty, but should usually include a mix of medical and surgical work. The SFP will give you a certain amount of protected academic time - this will usually be either day release or a whole academic block. What academic time covers will be discussed below.

After the SFP, you'll apply for specialty training. At this stage, you'll also be able to apply for an [Academic Clinical Fellowship](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/career-development/research-career-funding-programmes/predoctoral/academic-clinical-fellowship), funded by the NIHR (National Institute for Health and Care Research). This will be a separate application process
