# Academic writing resourcesß

I've collected a few resources over the years to help with any academic writing tasks, from assignments for class through to research papers. I would recommend branching out further than your own specific area of interest and seeing how other fields organise their work, as there may be someone doing something completely different to you that you could learn a lot from!


## General

I'd recommend speaking to your nearest library team about this sort of thing. They're experts in knowing which resources to go to, and often run workshops or drop-ins where you can practice and learn more. For students this will likely be your university library, but don't sleep on your hospital library either, if you have access! I've attended many a Zoom workshop covering critical analysis, source finding and lots of other useful skills via my hospital library whilst at medical school.

Here are a couple of examples of what to look for: 
1. My current NHS Trust, UHL, has the following sessions available at the library: [link to training calendar] (https://www.uhl-library.nhs.uk/trainingcalendar.html)
2. Same thing at the hospital I was based at during university: [University Hospitals Sussex](https://www.uhsussex.nhs.uk/professionals/knowledge-and-libraries/information-skills-teaching/)

To find these, you can google "{your hospital trust} + library services" and follow the links. If you're having difficulty just pop them an email or visit in person!

There's also lots of different individuals with useful websites.

[Dr Raul Pacheco-Vega](https://www.raulpacheco.org/) is a Full Professor in the Methods Lab of the Latin American Faculty for Social Sciences (Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales, FLACSO) Sede México. His website not only covers his interdisciplinary work but also includes a massive amount of advice and useful resources for anyone with academic writing tasks. From organising your work to the actual reading and writing, I'd recommend browsing through.

[Vrinda Nair](https://x.com/VnVrinda) is a doctoral candidate at Concordia University. She has a great Twitter/X page sharing thoughts and resources to help with all aspects of academic life, from writing resources to advice on choosing colour schemes for maximum impact when presenting. There are so many threads here full of advice, have a browse.

## Gathering sources
[Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) is a wonderful site where for any academic paper, you can find links to others. Covering both papers referenced by your one, as well as papers which reference it, it's a good way to get an initial handle on a field.

## Writing
Once you get to writing, [Phrasebank](https://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/) by [Dr John Morley](https://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/dr-john-morley/) from the University of Manchester has some excellent sentence frameworks and starters. If you're asking the question "how do I phrase this professionally?", "how do I say this concisely?" - this is a good place to start.

## Referencing
I'm a fan of [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) personally (especially now you can read PDFs in-app!), but this will also depend on specific projects - especially if you're collaborating with others, it is worth it to familiarise yourself with different reference managers.
