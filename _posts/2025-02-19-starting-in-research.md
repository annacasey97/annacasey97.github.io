# Research in medical school - actually doing it

So you've been invited to join in with a research project, but don't know where to start. Don't worry. It's all about gaining new skills and using them, and before you know it you're going to be an asset to your team.

# Basic skills

There are a couple of skills which you'll need before starting any work in the world of research. These aren't skills like statistical analysis which you'll learn 'on-the-job', but skills you should have at least a vague understanding of before starting.

## Reading

Reading is... fundamental! It's important you know how to read a paper, how to critically appraise literature, and are able to quickly find your way around new topics. Here's some help.

If you google 'how to read a paper', it'll show you some helpful places to start.

Prof. Trisha Greenhalgh's book [How to Read a Paper](https://www.bmj.com/content/315/7112/891.1) is a book which I think everyone apart from me has read, and it seems to be a good starting point. There's also this [series of articles](https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-readers/publications/how-read-paper) in the BMJ which look useful.

If reading isn't your jam, I can recommend the [Resus Room](https://www.theresusroom.co.uk/category/podcasts/) podcast which has a monthly journal club episode. It's EM-focussed, so not always the most relevant, but always a useful glimpse at what to look at when judging how relevant a paper will be to clinical practice.

In fact, any journal club will be really useful here, as it'll get you a) reading lots, and b) discussing paper quality which is important to the critical appraisal process. If you don't have a journal club at your university, consider setting one up.

There are also several online tools, such as [CASP](https://casp-uk.net/casp-tools-checklists/) which offer things like checklists for assessing evidence quality. The [Joanna Briggs Institute, JBI](https://jbi.global/critical-appraisal-tools) is another example.

You can also read the evidence section of NICE guidelines ([here](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng133/evidence)'s the one for hypertension in pregnancy) where the organisation outlines things like the searches it used, the criteria it assessed for and so on. This is useful for linking academic writing to clinical practice.

It can also be helpful to use the full range of library schemes you have access to as a medical student. When I was at university, I was part of the University of Brighton library, the University of Sussex library, the BSMS library and my local NHS Trust library. This meant I had 4 routes to finding resources I needed; 4 places to ask for academic support; and (annoyingly), 4 logins to juggle.

I'm now affiliated with the University of Leicester and University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust - 2 excellent libraries which can both offer support in finding and accessing resources.

In terms of finding papers, resources like [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) are so useful in mapping new areas of research. This is a website with a free tier (when I first used it back in 2019 it was completely free, so how times have changed!) where it shows you papers linked to any paper you tell it, what is often referenced, what often references it (i.e. what came before and what is happening afterwards), and is just good for a quick understanding of a new topic. Works best when you plug in a key paper, and is also good for identifying those key papers.

## Writing

The more you read, the better you'll write, so these two skills are very deeply linked.

Writing is something you'll hopefully be doing fairly often at university in the form of essays and so on, and there are a few skills which will help make this as easy as possible.

I like [PhraseBank](https://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/) from the University of Manchester, and would recommend my page on [Academic Writing](https://annacasey97.github.io/blog/2024/academic-writing-resources/) for more resources.

I also find that the more seamless my referencing workflow, the easier it is to get ideas to paper without worrying about where the information is coming from. With the appropriate browser extensions, referencing software and word processor plugins, you're literally a few clicks away from writing about papers you find.

# Less basic skills

There are a couple of skills which can be useful to develop, but are definitely not essential and won't be relevant to all projects.

## Systematic reviews

If you're working on a systematic review, which I'd recommend as a good starting point, I cannot recommend Covidence or Rayyan (open source version) highly enough. They are both websites which allow for screening of resources collaboratively, and just really make the whole experience so much easier. Import some to each, have a play around with a second account, and see how much easier it is than managing things manually.

## Statistical analysis

If you're affiliated with a university, chances are you have free access to a range of software packages. If your project needs someone to work out p-values, it's worth seeing if you can familiarise yourself with e.g. Stata, R, or Python for data analysis. There are also online resources for learning how to do this in any language. Check out YouTube for tutorials, the documentation for whichever language you're using, or things like [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for further education.

## Qualitative analysis

Similar to the above, learning how to use software like NVivo really broadens your skillset and ability to approach research questions. No longer will you be frustrated at your inability to understand the nuance around a quantitative paper - when you have the skills to add a qualitative dimension. Get a dataset, play around, and develop your toolkit for approaching questions.

# Putting it all together

I hope this gives you somewhere to start, and improves your confidence in putting yourself forward to get involved as a collaborator or co-author. Even if your project doesn't get published, these are all useful skills which will help throughout your work and education.
