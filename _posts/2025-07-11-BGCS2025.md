Today I attended the [British Gynaecological Cancer Society](https://www.bgcs.org.uk/)'s 2025 [Annual Scientific Meeting](https://www.bgcs.org.uk/event/asm-london-2025/#menu-item-1204_)

I could only attend the last day due to my shift pattern, which was a shame, but it was really enjoyable nevertheless.


1. Multidisciplinary working in gynae-oncology
- I really liked hearing from different surgical specialties about how they are involved in gyn-onc surgeries, what sort of skills they can offer and advice for working together for patients
- There's honestly so much cool surgery happening that I didn't fully realise, and still don't altogether understand
- It's heartening to see that we're not mortal enemies of the urologists!

2. Novel Technologies and Strategies
- Very interesting to see the breadth of different approaches to questions in gynae-oncology
- I had never heard of HIPEC or PIPAC so that was really eye opening

3. Short oral presentations
- Rapid presentations (each was 5 mins long) which I really enjoyed as a quick overview of a range of gynae-oncology topics
- Obviously my favourite was the one on ctDNA in endometrial cancer, but I also really liked the presentation of the FAIR-O study, looking at frailty assessment which is something I remember being emphasised in my surgical FY1 rotation

I also met representatives of [Peaches womb cancer trust](https://peachestrust.org/), which is a wonderful resource both for researchers like me to keep the work grounded and linked to people actually experiencing the disease, but also to signpost patients to in clinic.
