So now we get to the application. For SFP, this has changed recently so follow your medical school's guidance on the practical aspects. For ACF, it's on Oriel as another application in addition to your normal specialty applications.

Though the processes are different, the general requirements are going to be similar. Any additional research, teaching, publications, presentations, additional degrees, quality improvement you can demonstrate works in your favour.

The best time to do this is probably medical school. The vast majority of the things on my portfolio were done between my intercalated year after year 3 and graduation. You have more time - I know it doesn't feel like it! - than you will once you're working full time. I hope to add posts about maximising your portfolio in the future.

The two steps to each application are, broadly, the White Space Questions (WSQs) and the interview. The questions in each of these sections are, in my opinion, generally pretty simple to predict. There's always going to be some rogue ones, but the majority will be straghtforward, if not easy, to prepare for.

# White space questions

These are like mini-interview questions you'll need to type a response to in the application form on Oriel. They are there to give you an initial 'score' in order to invite people to interview. There are lots of resources online for this sort of thing - [here](https://app.medall.org/contents/v-a-guide-to-whitespace-questions-wsqs-specialised-foundation-programme-series)'s one I found on MedAll, for example.

Examples of SFP WSQs:
- Please outline your previous research experience and achievements
- What are your specific reasons for applying for a special experience programme?
- Give one example in which you have demonstrated your leadership abilities

Examples of ACF WSQs:
- Please give details of outstanding achievements outside the field of medicine
- What experience do you have of delivering teaching?
- Describe how you believe you meet the person specification for the programme you are applying for

I hope you'll agree that all of these - regardless of how much you have to write in each section - are pretty obvious job-interview-type questions. If you can't answer 'why do you want this job', or 'how are you qualified for this job', reflect more on your personal motivations - you will find something!

As for how you find these in advance, firstly seek online resources. You can probably just think for 5 minutes and come up with some potential questions, use your CV as a framework. There'll be something about teaching, something about your motivation, and so  on. In addition, speaking to previous applicants or trainees will also help - we're always happy to give advice and support (some of us even make websites to do so).

The actual list for the year of application will be released at the same time as the application window opens. There's no advantage to submitting your application early, so take as much time as possible to get them up to a good standard.

I'd also recommend having a few people 'on standby' to proofread and offer editing advice. These should be people who know you're applying; who know your CV; who know you personally, clinically and/or academically; and who have good writing skills. Tell them nice and early about this (i.e. as soon as you know you're applying), as when the applications open you may only have 10 days to craft your responses. If someone won't be available for such a quick turnaround, the sooner you can find a replacement the better.

Fundamentally, the answers to these questions will come from your CV. Update this regularly, and ensure you know what you can draw upon for your answers. Maybe there's some teaching you did in second year that you've forgotten about, or maybe you're underselling your research experience. Familiarise yourself with this and it'll be way easier to draft responses.

# Interviews

These are always stressful. If you're working (I was on my A+E placement), you'll have to hope you have the day off, or a relaxed department which will allow you to take time off potentially at short notice (I remember being given a matter of days to prepare for one of my ACF interviews, which was stressful).

If you're going for the SFP, there is again general advice about interviews [online](https://mindthebleep.com/sfp-introduction-to-interview/), but please note the dates everything was written, and if in doubt about whether or not you need to prepare for an interview, ask your medical school.

For ACFs, it's again a straightforward process but not necessarily easy. The interview questions are freely available on the [NIHR website](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/2025-academic-clinical-fellowships-medical-guidance-recruitment-and-appointment#tab-361726). Obviously if you're not a nerd, have a life, and don't read lengthy webpages fully, you'll miss this, but it's literally right there. They may ask more, but they'll always ask these.

In general, regular interview advice applies here. Practice in advance with more questions than you think they'll ask. There's always some curveballs. Again, know your CV and achievements, so you can think on your feet and focus on impressing the panel. Record yourself, or work with others to develop your interview skills and present yourself in the most effective way possible.

# Summary

In summary, your application will consist of WSQs and an interview. It is possible to prepare for each.

WSQs:
1. Think about possible questions and how you'd answer them
2. Assemble a 'WSQ panel' who can proofread and offer suggestions for improvement
3. Know your CV inside out to ensure maximum benefit from each experience

Interview:
1. Think about possible questions and how you'd answer them
2. For ACFs, the questions and mark schemes are literally publically available
3. Practice in advance - record yourself or get a friend to practice with
