I had a bunch of medical students asking about research experience in medical school, and how to go about it, so I wanted to share some general thoughts and strategies. This will depend on things like your own personal time (if you have children, a job, or caring responsibilities then these will be more challenging), as well as your university and access to mentors or supervisors.

Firstly, it should be noted that publications and presentations count for 2 different portfolio scoring sections; and that oral and poster presentations also count for different sections (though this can vary, check your specialty scoring details for more information). With this in mind, the ideal situation is doing one project that nets you multiple outputs - you might initially present it as a poster at a conference, then go on to publish it.

It should also be on your radar that not every project is going to lead anywhere. It is worth being upfront with supervisors. Something like "I'm interested in X/Y/Z specialty/area/method, and I want to maximise my competitiveness. I already have poster and oral presentations so would need a publication from this project." - immediately your supervisor is aware of where you're coming from, your priorities etc. and can be honest about how likely this is to avoid wasting time.

The absolute main points are probably these: connections and time.

The more people you know, the more likely they are to suggest opportunities to you. And the longer you give yourself to do things, the more time you have to accumulate success.
