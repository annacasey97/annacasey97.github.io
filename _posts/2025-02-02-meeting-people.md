I had a bunch of medical students asking about research experience in medical school, and how to go about it, so I wanted to share some general thoughts and strategies. This will depend on things like your own personal time (if you have children, a job, or caring responsibilities then these will be more challenging), as well as your university and access to mentors or supervisors.

Firstly, it should be noted that publications and presentations count for 2 different portfolio scoring sections; and that oral and poster presentations also count for different sections (though this can vary, check your specialty scoring details for more information). With this in mind, the ideal situation is doing one project that nets you multiple outputs - you might initially present it as a poster at a conference, then go on to publish it.

It should also be on your radar that not every project is going to lead anywhere. It is worth being upfront with supervisors. Something like "I'm interested in X/Y/Z specialty/area/method, and I want to maximise my competitiveness. I already have poster and oral presentations so would need a publication from this project." - immediately your supervisor is aware of where you're coming from, your priorities etc. and can be honest about how likely this is to avoid wasting time.

The absolute main points are probably these: connections and time.

The more people you know, the more likely they are to suggest opportunities to you. And the longer you give yourself to do things, the more time you have to accumulate success. Start early!

# Student groups

There will be local ones at your university, as well as some national ones. Google them!

Some to get you started:

- [InciSioN UK](https://www.incisionuk.com/)
- [STARSurg](https://starsurg.org/)
- [Students for Global Health](https://studentsforglobalhealth.org/)
- [BURST Urology](https://bursturology.com/)

Find whatever interests you. These are great for a few reasons.

- Meeting people!
  - If you're part of one of these groups or student societies, chances are you're interested in the specialty. This means you can meet others who are also interested! Work with them, take advice from those further along the road than yourself, and see what's out there!
- Opportunities
  - These groups routinely produce research outputs. Audits, papers, posters etc., this is the place to get involved in the developing knowledge in your specialty of interest, and get your name out there
- Learning
  - Do you actually want to do this specialty? Are you genuinely interested? Getting stuck in is the best way to find out if this is something you want to do! If you decide "hey, I hate surgery" - fantastic! At least you found out now rather than midway through CST

# Faculty, clinicians and students

These are also great! Chances are, if you're at a university, you're linked to a university hospital. This means you'll have professors, faculty members, and clinical academics surrounding you. Approach them!

Ideas:

- Ask a lecturer
  - If they're teaching you cool stuff, they're probably doing cool stuff on the side. Ask them if they need an extra pair of hands/eyes and offer your help. Even if they say no, they'll be thinking of you if an opportunity arises
- Ask a consultant
  - If you know what specialty you're interested in, on placement find a nice consultant and ask them if they know about any studies or projects happening in the department
- Ask other students
  - If you've got student-selected aspects (e.g. SSCs) or similar, find students who are doing things in areas you're interested in! They are at a very similar stage to you, and will likely have learning points which are very relevant and actionable
 
# Conferences

Similar to the student groups, if you're attending one of these it's likely you're interested in the topic. Make connections, exchange LinkedIn profiles or whatever the cool kids do these days, and find out what's new!

If you see a cool poster, reach out to the person who made it! If you attend an interesting talk, ask some questions afterwards. If you're a student, people will understand you might not have all the answers, and will hopefully be happy to offer advice and insights. Ask about their journeys - people take all sorts of paths to get to where they are, and it's useful to have a broader understanding of career options than just those presented at university.

# Other approaches

OK, so a lot of the above will be online, especially things like conferences. It's worth thinking outside the box though, and using social media, LinkedIn and other forums where you can find people doing interesting things. Think things like authors on publications, or even the news! I used to work with someone who did some really cool research with a team he made contact with after seeing them on the news!

# Wrapping up

I hope this has given you something to think about and some approaches to getting to know people which will help you get started with some research involvement. Please reach out to me if you think I have anything to add!
